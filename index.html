	<h1>Where & How Did Woolly Mammoths Live?</h1>
	<p>The woolly mammoth was found roaming the bitter Arctic tundra where they would often gather in large herds for both warmth and protection. Woolly mammoths lived in two groups which are thought to have been different enough to be characterized as separate subspecies. One woolly mammoth group stayed in the middle of the high Arctic, while the other woolly mammoth group had a much wider range.</p>
	<h2>What Did Woolly Mamoths Use Their Tusks For?</h2>
	<p>As elephants do today, the woolly mammoth had enormous tusks which would have been used for both digging and collecting food, and for intimidating and fighting off both predators and rivals. The tusks of the woolly mammoth were often quite dramatically curved and could easily be up to 16ft long.</p>

	<p class="image-info">This is supposedly what woolly mammoth's tusks looked like!</p>
	<h3>When Did Woolly Mammoths Become Extinct?</h3>
	<p>It was generally assumed that the last woolly mammoths vanished from Europe and Southern Siberia in around 8,000 BC, with the last of the isolated woolly mammoth populations vanishing from Wrangel Island, located in the Arctic Ocean in around 1700 BC. </p>
